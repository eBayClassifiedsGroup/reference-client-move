# Reference Client for MoVe Listing API

This repository contains a reference client implementation for the MoVe Listing API. It uses a simple Java Jersey doing REST calls and aims to be as simple and readable as possible.  

## How To Use This

The implementation contains 2 parts:

1) the client itself, utilizing JaxRs/Jersey
1) a number of tests that cover common usage scenarios

> To run the scenario tests, you need credentials for the MoVe sandbox environment and an assigned `partnerId`. If you haven't received those, pleae reach out to MoVe.
